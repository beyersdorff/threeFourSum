Introduction
============

Your task is to recreate the experiments and the report as described in
`report-example.pdf`. In the experiments, you will be comparing three
different implementations to solve the 3SUM and 4SUM problems, as
introduced in the first lecture. 

The assignment is to be solved alone.
Create a report in LaTeX and return it as a single zip file containing
the report in PDF format and all code you have produced on LearnIT by
the deadline. You may use your favorite programming language and
environment for the implementation and the experimental framework, but
the implementation examples will be provided Java and the experimental
framework examples in Python. We recommend that you follow the examples
and write the implementations in Java and create the framework in
Python, use Visual Studio Code as your IDE, and use a UNIX command line
for running the experiments, such as WSL on Windows, or the native
command-line environment on Mac, and this is the only environment we
will give support for, but you are free to choose any other environment.
We recommend that you use Overleaf to write the report. The remainder of
this instruction document contains detailed step-by-step instructions
for recreating the experiments, and constructing the report.

Relation to the lecture
=======================

This document provides enough detail for you to hopefully finish the experimental pipeline by putting blocks together.
While you can work on the project right from the beginning, the relation to the lectures is as follows:

- Lecture 1 introduces the 3SUM and 4SUM problem and discusses basic algorithms. 
- Lecture 2 discusses good practices in the design of experiments. 
- Lecture 3 goes into detail about evaluating experimental results in the form of tables and plots. It also provides more details on report writing.

Set up your environment (optional)
==================================

Follow the instructions on the LearnIT page under the title [*Recommended
software*](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/page/view.php?id=187114) to set up your environment. 
Note that since the course staff
has no access to clean experimental systems other than those that they
use for their daily work, the instructions have only been tested
partially; if you encounter any problems, please ask for help at the
Teams channel, or at the lab session.

While you are free to use any tools you wish, the recommended set of
tools is WSL (for Windows), git, Python 3 + associated libraries (NumPy,
Matplotlib) through Anaconda, Java 11, and Overleaf. The course staff
will only help with these tools, using other tools is at your own risk.

Fork & clone the repository
===========================

Head over to <https://github.itu.dk/algorithms/ThreeFourSum2023> and
*fork* the repository, creating a repository of your own under
<https://github.itu.dk>. You will use this repository as basis for your
experiments, and you are expected to store your code and your report
there.

*Clone* the repository to your local computer using `git`. Typically,
you would issue a command such as the following:

`$ git clone git@github.itu.dk:algorithms/ThreeFourSum2023.git ThreeFourSum2023`

Of course, replace the URL with the URL of your personal fork. You can
find out the URL by pressing the green button labeled "code".

Start working on your report in Overleaf
========================================

Under the repository, you will find a skeleton template for the report.
Head over to <http://overleaf.itu.dk/>, log in (or sign up if you
haven't done so already), and start a new project. If you choose a blank
project, Overleaf may create a `main.tex` for you. You can delete that
file; instead, upload the `report-skeleton.tex` you just downloaded with
`git`.

Hit the green button that says *recompile*. On the right hand side, the
compiled version of the report template. Adjust the author and title
information of your new report, recompile your new report, and make sure
that the changes become visible.

Create a new Gradle project for 3SUM
====================================

This section is optional, but recommended if you want to use Gradle for
your project. Since we are starting to work on the 3SUM first, let us
create a new Gradle project for the problem. Start by creating a
directory called `threesum`, then initialize the directory as a Gradle
project. We assume that we are operating under our repository.

```bash 
$ mkdir threesum 
$ cd threesum 
$ gradle init
```

Make the following selections:
```
    Select type of project to generate:
      1: basic
      2: application
      3: library
      4: Gradle plugin
    Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

    Select implementation language:
      1: C++
      2: Groovy
      3: Java
      4: Kotlin
      5: Scala
      6: Swift
    Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 3

    Split functionality across multiple subprojects?:
      1: no - only one application project
      2: yes - application and library projects
    Enter selection (default: no - only one application project) [1..2] 1

    Select build script DSL:
      1: Groovy
      2: Kotlin
    Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

    Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may
    change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no] no
    Select test framework:
      1: JUnit 4
      2: TestNG
      3: Spock
      4: JUnit Jupiter
    Enter selection (default: JUnit Jupiter) [1..4] 1

    Project name (default: threesum): threesum
    Source package (default: threesum): threesum

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 27s
    2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

This should create a directory structure such as the following:

    ./app/build.gradle
    ./app/src/test/resources
    ./app/src/test/java/threesum/AppTest.java
    ./app/src/main/resources
    ./app/src/main/java/threesum/App.java
    ./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
    ./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
    ./gradlew
    ./.gitignore
    ./.gitattributes
    ./.gradle
    ./.gradle/file-system.probe
    ./gradlew.bat
    ./settings.gradle

**Obs.** If you did not get an interactive menu as described above, it
might be due to an old version of Gradle. Alternatively, you can issue
the following command:

`$ gradle init –type java-application –test-framework junit`

This should yield the same file and directory structure.

Whichever way you did it, you should now have a skeleton project that
you can build and run. Your implementation code will go to the file
`./app/src/main/java/threesum/App.java`, which you can of course
rename, and your test code goes to
`./app/src/test/java/threesum/AppTest.java`. Now might be a good time to
commit your changes in the repository since you want to keep all of
these files, but not necessarily the files that will be built when you
first build your code. You can do this by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "initial version"
```

The first command adds all files in the present directory in the commit,
the second file actually stores the changes in the *local* repository.
You also want to copy the changes over to the *remote* repository by
issuing

`$ git push`

Let us now try to build our project. Running the following command will
compile the code and run unit tests.

`$ ./gradlew build`

If the build was successful, try running the actual executable app by
running

`$ ./gradlew run`

This should print `Hello World!` on the screen.

The filename `App.java` is a bit off, so let us rename it to
`ThreeSum.java`. To rename a tracked file in `git`, we can issue the
command

`$ git mv app/src/main/java/threesum/App.java app/src/main/java/threesum/Threesum.java`

Likewise, let us rename `AppTest.java` to `ThreeSumTest.java`:

`$ git mv app/src/test/java/threesum/AppTest.java app/src/test/java/threesum/ThreeSumTest.java`

However, the build will now fail because Java expects the class name to
match the filename. So open up the `.java` files and rename the classes
`App` and `AppTest` to `ThreeSum` and `ThreeSumTest`, respectively, to
match the filenames. Additionally, remember to change the class name
`App` to `ThreeSum` on the first lines of the `main` method of
`Threesum` and the `appHasAGreeting` method of `ThreeSumTest`. The build
should succeed now

However, you still need to make one more change to fix running the
application, as you will need to update the information about the main
class by editing the file `app/build.gradle` and replacing the line

    application {
        // Define the main class for the application.
        mainClass = 'threesum.App'
    }

with

    application {
        // Define the main class for the application.
        mainClass = 'threesum.ThreeSum'
    }

With these changes, also `./gradlew run` should work again.

However, when running experiments we *really* don't want to use
`./gradlew run`, but we want to create a self-contained JAR package.
This can be done easily by adding a new target in `app/build.gradle`:

    jar {
        manifest {
            attributes 'Main-Class': 'threesum.ThreeSum'
        }
    }

This instructs Gradle to build a JAR package that contains all
dependencies, and whose main class is the same `ThreeSum` class as
before. You can then build the JAR package by issuing

`$ ./gradlew jar`

This should create the JAR file under `./app/build/libs/app.jar`. You
can then directly launch it by running

`$ java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar`

Check that your JAR package works.

Solve the 3SUM problem in three different ways
==============================================

Check the `algorithms.pdf` file under the repository to recap the problem definition of 3SUM.
Study the three different approaches to solve the problem there and make sure you understand the pseudocode.

**Your task.** Copy the code of the implementations of the algorithms
into your project. If you want to use some other programming language
than Java, you can use the code use as basis for creating an
implementation of your own. Check that the code works by calling the
routines with some suitable arguments.

## Implementation of the cubic algorithm in Java. 

```java
public static int[] threeSumCubic(int[] x) {
    int n = x.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int a = x[i];
        for (int j = i+1; j < n; ++j) {
            int b = x[j];
            for (int k = j+1; k < n; ++k) {
                int c = x[k];
                if (a + b + c == 0) {
                    return new int[] { a, b, c };
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

## Implementation of the quadratic algorithm in Java. 

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public static int[] threeSumQuadratic(int[] x) {
    int n = x.length;
    int[] y = x.clone();
    Arrays.sort(y);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int a = y[i];
        int left = i+1;
        int right = n-1;
        while (left < right) {
            int b = y[left];
            int c = y[right];
            if (a+b+c == 0) {
                return new int[] { a, b, c};
            }
            else if (a+b+c < 0) {
                ++left;
            }
            else {
                --right;
            }
        }
    }

    return null;
}
```

## Implementation of the hash map algorithm in Java. 

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public static int[] threeSumHashMap(int[] x) {
    int n = x.length;
    HashMap<Integer,Integer> H = 
        new HashMap<Integer,Integer>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        H.put(x[i], i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int a = x[i];
        for (int j = i+1; j < n; ++j) {
            int b = x[j];
            int c = -a - b;
            Integer k = H.get(c);
            if (k != null && j < k) {
                return new int[] { a, b, c };
            }
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

Add tests to check the correctness of your implementation
=========================================================

When you implement algorithms, it is important to write tests to verify
the correctness of your implementation. It might be a good idea to apply
the paradigm of *Test-Driven Development (TDD)*: write some unit tests
first, make sure that they fail, and then implement the missing
functionality. It is important to check that the tests fail to make sure
that the tests are actually evaluated.

If you created the Gradle project following the instructions from above,
you can easily create unit tests by adding new methods in the
`ThreeSumTests.java` file. The tests must be annotated with `@Test`. If
you are unfamiliar with JUnit, have a look at the [JUnit website](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Assertions) for
some examples about *assertions*. Assertion makes a statement that
should be true, and the test fails if the assertion does not hold. You
are going to need at least the assertions `assertNull` to verify that a
test case that should not return an solution indeed does return `null`,
`assertNotNull` to verify that the method actually returns a solution,
and `assertArrayEquals` to verify that the method returns the exact
solution specified. The tests can be run by executing

`$ ./gradlew test`

The following example shows how to check trivial cases with the
cubic algorithm.

```java
package threesum;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNull;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;;

public class ThreeSumTest {
    @Test 
    public void testCubic() {
        assertNull(ThreeSum.threeSumCubic(
            new int [] { 1, 2, 3 }
        ));
        assertNotNull(ThreeSum.threeSumCubic(
            new int [] { 1, 2, -3 }
        ));
        assertArrayEquals(new int[] { 1, 2, -3 },
           ThreeSum.threeSumCubic(new int [] { 
               1, 2, -3 
           })
        );
    }
}
```

**Your task.** Verify the correctness of the routines given to you by
writing suitable test cases. You should test all three routines, and
with variable cases. Include cases where there are 0, 1, or multiple
triplets summing to 0. Include cases where there are fewer than 3
integers in the list. Include a case where there is an empty list.
Include cases where there are several equal integers and where all
integers are distinct.

Create another version of the hash map implementation where you remove
the comparison (`&& j < k`). Find a case that provides incorrect output
(reports an invalid triple), and write a test that verifies that the
original implementation provides correct output and that the version
without comparison does not.

Write one or two paragraphs in the report on how you tested your code
for correctness.

Input/Output
============

Our stand-alone application is not very interesting unless it can run
the desired algorithms with the given input. In order to do this, we
need to specify how the algorithm is chosen, how input is passed, and
how output is returned to the caller. We are going to do this as
follows:

-   The program will take one [*command-line argument*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Arguments) that selects
    the algorithm,

-   The input is passed through [*standard input*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)) in the following
    format: the first line will contain an integer that tells the number
    $n$ of integers in the list, followed by another line that contains
    $n$ space-separated integers,

-   The output is produced to [*standard output*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)) as follows: if a
    suitable triple $(a,b,c)$ is found, the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$
    are written space separated into output, otherwise the string `null`
    is written to mark that no solution could be found.

Standard input can be accessed via `System.in` in Java, and reading such
data is easy with the `Scanner` class.
The example below shows a Java routine that reads data in the
format specified above, and returns an array if $n$ `int`s. Note that
this routine is not very error-tolerant, as it contains no kinds of
safeguards against malformed input, and as such, is probably
inappropriate for production code that is exposed to outside users.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public static int[] readData() {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    int[] x = null;
    try {
        int n = s.nextInt();
        x = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            x[i] = s.nextInt();
        }    
    }
    finally {
        s.close();
    }
    return x;
}
```

Command-line arguments are simple to access in Java: they are contained
in the `args` array that is always passed to the `main` method. We
simply need to select the algorithm based on what is the first element
of the array. We shall specify, that the first element must be `cubic`,
`quadratic`, or `hashmap`, and select the algorithm and store the result
as an array.

Finally, standard output is accessed by printing to `System.out`. We
just need to check whether the array we got from our algorithm is
`null`, and potentially use formatted printing to pretty-print our
result. The full `main` method is shown in
below. Again, the code is not very
error-resistant, and specifically fails to address the cases where input
is malformed, no command-line parameters are passed, or the command-line
parameter does not match one of our specified choices.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] x = readData();
    int[] y = null;
    
    if ("cubic".equals(args[0])) {
        y = threeSumCubic(x);
    }
    else if ("quadratic".equals(args[0])) {
        y = threeSumQuadratic(x);
    }
    else if ("hashmap".equals(args[0])) {
        y = threeSumHashMap(x);
    }

    if (y == null) {
        System.out.println("null");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println(String.format("%d %d %d", 
            y[0], y[1], y[2]));
    }
}
```



A potential session could look like following, assuming the project has
been built as a JAR package using Gradle as suggested:

```bash 
$ java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar cubic
3
1 2 3
null
$ java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar cubic
3
1 2 -3
1 2 -3
```
**Your task.** Implement the main method and any auxiliary functions you
require, and check that you can run your self-contained program on the
command-line, and that it produces the expected output.

Run Java applications from Python
=================================

We are going to build our experimental framework in Python. We will
start by setting up the possibility of running Java applications. This
can be done through the `subprocess` module. The module allows the
creation of subprocesses which will independently run whatever code we
wish, and we can communicate with the subprocess by feeding it data
through the standard input, and receive data from standard output.

The following code shows an example of how to do this in Python. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess
TIMEOUT = 30

# run the given jar package,
# provide the given arg as the command-line 
# argument,
# feed the given input string to the stdin of the 
# process,
# and return the stdout from the process as string
def run_java(jar: str, arg: str, input: str)->str:
    p = subprocess.Popen(['java','-jar',jar,arg], 
        stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    (output,_) = p.communicate(input.encode('utf-8'), 
        timeout=TIMEOUT)
    return output.decode('utf-8')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(run_java('threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar',
        'cubic','3\n1 2 3'))
    print(run_java('threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar',
        'cubic','3\n1 2 -3'))
```

The global
variable `TIMEOUT` sets a timeout at 30 seconds, after which an
exception is raised if the process has not terminated. The special
`PIPE` objects instruct the subprocess to receive and send data to the
calling Python process; if these are not provided as arguments to the
`Popen` function, the standard streams are connected to the calling
process of the Python interpreter. Finally, instead of a main method,
the convention in Python is to separate the executable application code
from library code by an `if`-block. This block shows how the `run_java`
function is expected to be called.

Assuming the code is placed one level above in the directory hiearchy
from the Gradle project in a file, such as `experiments.py` or whatever
you want to call the file, the expected output of the code is

```
    null

    1 2 -3
```

**Your task.** Copy the code from above into a file, and experiment with it. Make
sure you know how to call your algorithms from Python, and that you get
the expected output.

Generating input data
=====================

The parameter the scaling with respect which we are interested in is the
*number of elements* in a list $n$, but the routines we described take
actual lists, not just the number of elements. Furthermore, we want the
input to exhibit *worst case behavior* because our algorithms have an
*early termination* property: the execution is terminated as soon as a
positive example is found. We are usually interested in worst-case
performance which in the case of 3SUM is the one where we cannot find a
suitable triple. Furthermore, we want to be able to ensure that every
time we run the experiments, we use the same data, so as to make our
experiments reproducible.

Our plan is as follows: we are going to create lists of variable length $n$ 
consisting of random *positive* integers. This ensures that there
will not be a satisfying triple, and this is the worst case. We will
make $M$ repetitions for each value $n$, so there will be $M$ different
lists of $n$ elements, for each $n$ we will try.

We will fix some value $i_{\max}$ to be the number of different values
of $n$ that we will try, and we will use the following formula to
determine the values that we will use: $$n_i = 30 \cdot 1.41^i,$$
for $i=0,1,\ldots,i_{\max}-1$. This means that every subsequent number
of elements $n_i$ is approximately a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ away from the
previous value; this should provide a sufficient resolution for
determining the scalability, while at the same time providing a
sufficient range of different values.

For reproducibility, we are going to use a fixed *seed* that will
initialize the random number generator to produce the exact same
sequence of numbers each time. In addition, we are going to construct
the input data beforehand, and we are going to provide the same input
data to all algorithms.

The next code snippet shows how to do this using NumPy. NumPy is a very
useful library that provides, in particular, advanced linear algebra
functions. In this case, however, we use its faculties for constructing
random numbers using a high-quality pseudorandom number generator
(PRNG).

```python
from typing import List, Dict
import numpy as np # type: ignore

TIMEOUT = 30

# how many different values of n
I_MAX: int = 30
# the different values of n
NS: List[int] = [int(30 * 1.41**i) \
    for i in range(I_MAX)]
# how many repetitions for the same n
M: int = 5
# seed for the pseudorandom number generator
SEED: int = 314159
# the PRNG object
rng = np.random.default_rng(SEED)
# The generated input:
# The dictionary maps n to a list of lists
# each list contains M lists of n ints
INPUT_DATA: Dict[int,List[List[int]]] = {
    n : [rng.integers(1, 2**28, n) \
         for _ in range(M)] \
    for n in NS
}
```
The input will be stored in a *dictionary* called `INPUT_DATA`.
The keys of the dictionary correspond to the values of $n$ we are using
that are stored in the list `NS`. Each value `INPUT_DATA[n]` is a list
of $M$ lists, each of which contains $n$ `int`s. The maximum value is
set at $2^{28}-1$ to prevent negative values from occurring in the sums
because of integer overflows.

**Your task.** Copy the above code to create input. Play with the
different parameters to see how they interact with one another.

**Caveats.** Standard libraries may contain substandard pseudorandom
number generators, and some algorithms are sensitive to the correlations
that such poor random number generators produce! This is particularly
true if one uses the `rand` function from the C standard library, as the
typical implementations are very poor *Linear Congruential Generators*
with short periods and large amounts of correlation between the numbers
produced. Therefore, it may sometimes be necessary to be even aware of
the properties of the random numbers generators that are being used to
avoid systematic erros from creeping into the experiments.

Add a framework for measuring runtimes
====================================

For making measurements, we will create a function that takes in as
argument the choice of algorithm which will be passed to the Java
application, and the input data for the particular run. As result, the
function will return the number of seconds it took for the Java
application to execute.

In Python, the current time can be recorded by using the `time` module,
and specifically the function `time()`. To get the current time, one
would call `time.time()`. The precise meaning of this value is
implementation dependent, but on most systems it is a floating point
number that records the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
(UTC), commonly known as Unix time.

The following code snippet shows a potential implementation of `measure`,
followed by a potential invocation of the function. 

```python
from typing import List
import time

def measure(algorithm: str, jar: str, 
    input: List[int])->float:
    input_string: str = f'{len(input)}\n' + \
        ' '.join(map(str,input))
    start: float = time.time()
    result_string: str = run_java(jar, algorithm, 
        input_string)
    end: float = time.time()
    assert result_string.strip() == 'null'
    return end - start

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(measure('cubic', 
        'threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar',
        INPUT_DATA[30][0]))
```

As the `run_java`
function assumes the input is given as a string, we start by converting
the input into the correct format. Then, we record the start time, run
the Java application, and record the end time. The assertion
is to ensure that the expected result was provided by the application:
if this assertion were to fail, we would know something is wrong.

**Your task.** Implement the measurement function by copying the code
from above. Try varying the arguments to make sure you
understand how it works. In particular, try varying the `TIMEOUT`
parameter and try to see what happens when the timeout is exceeded.

**A word of warning.** We measure the wall clock time here, not CPU
time, and the measurements are not particularly accurate. As they can
only represent macroscopic time scales with reasonable accuracy, they
are not suited for microbenchmarks. There are a multitude of reasons for
this, starting from the fact that we are running our application under
an operating system that implements pre-emptive multitasking: other load
will be invariably present on the system and we cannot easily control
how the operating system chooses to allocate resources for our program.

You should not rely on your measurements if the runtime of your function
is too low; in practice, you should only rely on measurements when they
are in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, or preferably seconds. And
even then, you should always perform several iterations to average out
random fluctuations. Note that the runtime also includes the time it
takes to set up the virtual machine and the application, which will
dominate the runtime for small inputs.

Also, it might be wise to perform sanity checks. If you expect your code
to run for seconds, but the function returns nanoseconds or
microseconds, something is off, and vice versa.

Performing benchmarks
=====================

Once you have the machinery set up for performing individual
measurements, you should start planning for a set of experiments. In
practice, since we are interested in the growth of the runtime of the
algorithm, we want to (i) try different values of the parameter $n$, and
(ii) perform several repetitions at each value of $n$ to average out
random fluctuations in the measurements.

The structure of the routine that we need should be something like the
following: Iterate over each parameter value $n$, and for each $n$,
iterate $M$ times call the measurement function with the particular data
associated with the $(n,i)$ pair corresponding to the input size and the
repetition $i$; if all $M$ repetitions were successful, store the
runtimes, but if timeout was exceeded, terminate and drop the results
for the last parameter value. As a result, return a list of $(n,t)$
pairs where we record the parameter value and the runtime.

An example function following this paradigm is seen here:
```python
def benchmark(algorithm: str, jar: str)-> \
    List[Tuple[int,float]]:
    results: List[Tuple[int,float]] = list()

    for n in NS:
        try: 
            result_n: List[Tuple[int,float]] = list()
            for i in range(M):
                input: List[int] = INPUT_DATA[n][i]
                diff: float = measure(algorithm,jar,
                    input)
                result_n.append((n,diff))
            results += result_n
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            break
    return results
```

The list `results` will be populated with
individual results. The results for a particular value of $n$ are stored
in the temporary list `result_n`, and all $M$ values are stored in
`results` only if timeout is not exceeded. If you played with the
timeout in the previous task, you should have noticed that exceeding the
timeout will cause a `TimeoutExpired` exception to be raised. What the
code does is catch this exception and terminate the benchmark. As such,
it is possible that some values of $n$ are not measured if smaller
values caused timeout to be exceeded.

**Your task.** Implement the benchmark function by copying the code above. Check that you know how to call it.

**Caveats.** While we are happy with this structure for this particular
assignment, there are some things that we need to be wary of. For
example, we generate all our input beforehand and pass it to the
subroutine at once. This works when the input is sufficiently small that
the combined input across all iterations can fit the RAM of a computer
at once, but in some cases this might be prohibitive from the point of
RAM use. In such cases, the code should be modified such that the input
is not provided as a simple input parameter, but it is generated or
retrieved upon need before performing the individual measurement.

Putting it all together
=======================

We now have all the ingredients we need to actually perform the
experiments. The plan is as follows: 

1. iterate over a list of
*instances* that determine which algorithms to benchmark, 
2. run the
`benchmark` function to obtain a list of $(n,t)$ pairs, that is, problem
size-runtime pairs, and 
3. store the values in a comma-separated
values (CSV) file for further processing. 

CSV files are regular text
files where observations are presented on rows, and individual values
corresponding to an observation are separated by commas. The data can
then be read with Pandas, NumPy, Excel, Matlab, or a multitude of other
tools at ease.

The following code snippet shows how to do this. 

```python
import csv

INSTANCES: List[Tuple[str,str]] = [
    ('cubic', 'threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar'),
    ('quadratic', 'threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar'),
    ('hashmap', 'threesum/app/build/libs/app.jar')
]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open('results.csv','w') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, 
            fieldnames = ['algorithm','n','time'])
        writer.writeheader()
        for algorithm, jar in INSTANCES:
            results: List[Tuple[int,float]] = \
                benchmark(algorithm,jar)
            for (n,t) in results:
                writer.writerow({ 
                    'algorithm' : algorithm,
                    'n' : n,
                    'time' : t
                })
```

We start by opening the
file `results.csv` for writing. We then use a `DictWriter` from the
`csv` module to write a CSV file that includes a header for the fields.
Then, we iterate over all of the instances we want to experiment with,
obtain results using the `benchmark` function, and finally write the
results row-by-row in the output file.

**Your task.** Implement the full set of experiments using the
subroutines developed in previous sections.

Computing statistics
====================

The experimental framework developed in previous sections is
self-contained and produces a single file, `results.csv`, as output. We
can thus move to postprocessing the raw results into more useful data.
We will start constructing a new Python file from scratch, so the
following code will go to a separate file; that way, we do not need to
run the experiments again every time we want to make changes to the
postprocessing of the data.

We will start by computing some very basic statistics, such as the mean
and standard deviation of the runtimes.
the next code snippet shows how to read the CSV file, convert the
results into a dictionary that uses the algorithm as a key to map to
another dictionary that uses the parameter $n$ as a key to map the
parameter value to a list of measurements, and then uses Numpy functions
to compute the mean and standard deviation. The result will be a
dictionary that maps the algorithm name to a Numpy array of three
columns. The first column will contain the problem size $n$, the second
column will contain the averate runtime for that particular problem
size, and the third column will contain the standard deviation.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import csv
from typing import Dict, List
import numpy as np # type: ignore

def read_results(filename: str)-> \
    Dict[str,Dict[int,List[float]]]:
    results: Dict[str,Dict[int,List[float]]] = dict()
    with open(filename,'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            algorithm: str = row['algorithm']
            n: int = int(row['n'])
            t: float = float(row['time'])
            if algorithm not in results:
                results[algorithm] = dict()
            if n not in results[algorithm]:
                results[algorithm][n] = list()
            results[algorithm][n].append(t)
    return results

def compute_mean_std(raw: Dict[int,List[float]])-> \
    np.ndarray:
    result = np.zeros((len(raw),3))
    for i, n in enumerate(sorted(raw)):
        result[i,0] = n
        result[i,1] = np.mean(raw[n])
        result[i,2] = np.std(raw[n], ddof=1)
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    raw_results: Dict[str,Dict[int,List[float]]] = \
        read_results('results.csv')
    refined_results: Dict[str,np.ndarray] = dict()
    for algorithm in raw_results:
        refined_results[algorithm] = \
            compute_mean_std(raw_results[algorithm])
```



**Your task.** Copy the code in a separate file, such as
`postprocess.py`, and make sure you understand how the data is stored
and how to access the data.

Generating tables
=================

In order to report our results to the public, we need to be able to
present it in a human-readable form. For very particular results and
fine-grained, we can use tables. We will practice this by presenting the
results of all of our algorithms in tabular form.

As the report is written in LaTeX, it is natural to use the tabular
facilities of LaTeX to include a table of results in the report. The
syntax for creating such tables is a little unwieldy, though, so it
makes sense to create a script that automagically generates the tables
from the results. This also makes it easy to update the values if the
experiments are rerun; doing this manually would be a lot of work.

The next code snippet shows how to create a LaTeX tabular from the results
in Python. 

```python
def write_latex_tabular(res: np.ndarray, 
    filename: str):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(r'\begin{tabular}{rrr}' + '\n')
        f.write(r'$n$ & Average (s) & ' + \
            'Standard deviation (s)')
        f.write(r'\\\hline' + '\n')
        for i in range(res.shape[0]):
            fields = [str(int(res[i,0])),
                f'{res[i,1]:.6f}',
                f'{res[i,2]:.6f}']
            f.write(' & '.join(fields) + r'\\'+'\n')
        f.write(r'\end{tabular}' + '\n')
```

Following the example in the preceding section, the function
could be called by issuing the following statement:

`write_latex_tabular(refined_results['cubic'], 'threesum_cubic_tabular.tex')`

One possible point that may need adjustment is the number of decimals to
include in the string representation of the values. Here, the values are
set to be represented at 6 decimals, and whether this is appropriate or
not, depends on the range of values in the results.

**Your task.** Include a LaTeX table in your report. In both cases, the
resulting table can be included in the LaTeX document by

`\input{threesum_cubic_tabular.tex}`

The `\input` command simply pastes whatever content the file has to the
place where the command is placed. This should be done within the
`table` environment to enable labels and captions for the table. The
source code of the `report-skeleton.tex` file shows how to do this.

Making plots
============

While tables provide an exact listing of the data, it may be difficult
to see larger trends in a table of numbers. Visualizing the data by
plotting can be a useful tool.

The next code snippet shows how to plot the data using
`matplotlib` which is the de facto standard plotting library for Python.
The code in `matplotlib` is organized in terms of *figures* that contain
one or more *axes*. The function `subplots()`, without any arguments,
creates a new figure with a single axis. The axis object does the heavy
lifting of creating the actual plots. The `errorbar` function can be
used to create a lineplot of the average values with error bars
corresponding to the standard deviations of the observations. Observe
the order of the arguments: the $x$ values, the $y$ values (averages),
and the $y$-axis error values (standard deviations). We also include
markers for the actual data points. It is important that the figure is
saved in PDF format because this preserves the vector structure of the
plot, and can be included in PDF formatted documents without loss of
quality.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # type: ignore
  
def plot_algorithms(res: Dict[str,np.ndarray], 
    filename: str):
    (fig, ax) = plt.subplots()
    algorithms = ['cubic', 'quadratic', 'hashmap']
    for algorithm in algorithms:
        ns = res[algorithm][:,0]
        means = res[algorithm][:,1]
        stds = res[algorithm][:,2]
        ax.errorbar(ns, means, stds, marker='o', 
            capsize = 3.0)
    ax.set_xlabel('Number of elements $n$')
    ax.set_ylabel('Time (s)')
    ax.set_xscale('log')
    ax.set_yscale('log')
    ax.legend(['Cubic algorithm', 
        'Quadratic algorithm', 'Hashmap algorithm'])
    fig.savefig(filename)
```

Note that the resulting plot has a logarithmic scale on the $x$ and $y$
axes. This means that, rather than increasing by a constant amount, the
values increase in powers along the axes. This is justified in the case
of this assignment because the difference in the growth of the runtime
of the different algorithms is so large that otherwise the plot of the
faster, quadratic algorithm would amount to little more than a straight
line. You are welcome to try out what happens if the scale is linear!
Furthermore, by the rules for logarithms, we know that
$\log n^k = k \log n$, so this means that if the $x$ axis is logarithmic
as well, the power $k$ should match the slope as $n$ grows.

**Your task.** Create a plot that shows the runtimes of the algorithms
as a function of $n$ on a logarithmic scale. Include the resulting PDF
in your report.

Extending your framework to 4SUM
================================

You should now have all the tools for conducting an experiment. It is
now time to extend your framework to a related, but slightly more
challenging problem: the 4SUM. The problem is almost the same: given a
list of $n$ integers, do there exist four integers in the list $a$, $b$,
$c$, and $d$, such that $a+b+c+d=0$?

Check out the pseudocode in the accompanying PDF to see three solutions to the problem. These algorithms mimic those for the 3SUM problem, but are adapted for the 4SUM problem.
Note that when implementing the code some care must be taken. For example, the hash map
maps integers to pairs of integers; you will probably need to store
arrays in the Java `HashMap`.

**Your task.** Implement
Algorithms the three algorithms provided as pseudocode. In your report, discuss the running times
and tradeoffs between the algorithms: how do they scale theoretically in
terms of runtime and space complexity? Test your implementation for
correctness. Perform a similar benchmark as you did with 3SUM to compare
the runtimes of these algorithms. Produce a plot that shows the runtimes
of the algorithms as a function of $n$ in a logarithmic scale.

Finish up the report
====================

We have now described all the necessary tools and tasks that you need to
write your report. Use the file `report-skeleton.tex` as a starting
point.

Return your assignment on LearnIT by the deadline as a zip file
containing a single PDF report of at most 4 pages (without changes to the template layout) and all of the code you produced.
